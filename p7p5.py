def p7p5():
    """
Write a program that sums the integers in the range 1â€“10 000 that are divisable by 3 or by 5 and
prints out the total.
Create a limit
Create a num
Create a counter for them
I used num + 1 instead of +=
I then used a similar method to P7p5
E.g. num % 5 and num % 3
Then made a summer, where total = total + num(1)

        total = total + num
